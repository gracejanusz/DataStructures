# Data Structures Class Projects in Java

Welcome to the repository for my Data Structures class projects, all implemented in Java. This collection showcases various algorithms and data structures I have worked on during the course. The projects are organized into separate folders for each topic, providing a clear and structured overview of the concepts covered.

## Introduction

This repository contains Java projects that cover fundamental data structures and algorithms. The projects include implementations and demonstrations of:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Heaps
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms

Each project is designed to illustrate the use of data structures and algorithms in solving common problems.

## Setup and Requirements

To get started with these projects, you'll need:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher is recommended.
- **Eclipse IDE:** This repository was developed using Eclipse. Importing the project into Eclipse will ensure that the `.classpath` and `.project` files are correctly recognized.

### Instructions for Eclipse

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures-class-projects.git
   ```

2. **Import into Eclipse:**
   - Open Eclipse.
   - Go to `File` > `Import`.
   - Select `Existing Projects into Workspace` and click `Next`.
   - Browse to the location of the cloned repository and select it.
   - Click `Finish`.

3. **Build and Run:**
   - Right-click on the project in the Project Explorer.
   - Select `Run As` > `Java Application` to run the main class.

## How to Run

To run any of the projects, you need to locate the appropriate `Main` class in each folder. Right-click on the `Main` class file and select `Run As` > `Java Application`. Ensure that your IDE is set to use the correct Java version.
